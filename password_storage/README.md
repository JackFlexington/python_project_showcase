# Password Storage

## Video
![GIF password app](https://github.com/JackFlexington/python_project_showcase/blob/master/password_storage/password_app.gif)

## Libraries used
* tKinter
* sqlite3

## How it works
Using the tKinter library, constructed a graphical user interface that ties back to a database. This interface enables users to store sensitive data, such as username and password combinations. 

### Procedures:
* Construct database, if necessary.
* Use tKinter to construct graphical user interface.
* Now is the point where the user can interact with the software. (See video for context)

### Notes:
* Somewhere around 200 lines of code.

## Installation:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk; # Install tKinter (Just in case it didn't install with your Python IDE installation)
```

## Running the application
```bash
python3 password_storage.py; # Run application
```
