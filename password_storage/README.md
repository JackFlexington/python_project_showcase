# Password Storage

## Video
[password app gif]()

## Libraries used
* tKinter
* sqlite3

## How it works
Split the application across to files, database.py and passwordstorage.py, one handling the "back-end" and one handling the "front-end". Once the application is open, loads database into the application and allows user to interact with the data contained within.

### Procedures:
* Construct database, if necessary.
* Use tKinter to construct graphical user interface.
* Now is the point where the user can interact with the software. (See video for context)

### Notes:
* Somewhere around 200 lines of code.
